description: In 1947, a rash of sightings of Unexplained Flying Objects (UFOs) swept
  America. Although the newly formed U.S. Air Force was the primary investigator of
  these sightings, the FBI received many reports and worked for a time with the Air
  Force to investigate these matters. This release, declassified and made public in
  response to a U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, details the FBI's
  role in investigating UFO reports between 1947 and 1954.
